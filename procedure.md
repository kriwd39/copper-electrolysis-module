# Experimental Procedure: Electrolysis of Aqueous Copper(II) Sulfate Using Copper Electrodes

## Objective
To demonstrate the principles of electrolysis, metal purification, and Faraday's laws by electrolyzing an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO₄) with copper electrodes.

## Materials
### Chemicals
- Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O), ~1.0 M solution (approx. 250 mL)
- Distilled or deionized water (for preparing solutions)
- **Optional**: dilute sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, 0.1 M) to adjust pH

### Equipment
- Two clean copper electrodes (strips or plates, ~5 cm × 2 cm)
- Direct current (DC) power supply (0‑12 V, 0‑2 A) or a 6‑V battery
- Ammeter (or multimeter capable of measuring current up to 2 A)
- Voltmeter (optional, for monitoring cell voltage)
- 250‑mL beaker (or similar glass container)
- Connecting wires with alligator clips
- Analytical balance (±0.001 g)
- Stopwatch or timer
- Rinse bottle with distilled water
- Drying oven or hot plate (for drying electrodes before weighing)

## Safety Precautions
1. **Personal protective equipment (PPE):** Wear safety goggles, lab coat, and gloves.
2. **Copper(II) sulfate** is an irritant; avoid skin contact and do not ingest.
3. **Electricity hazard:** Ensure all connections are secure and dry before turning on the power supply. Never handle live wires with wet hands.
4. **Disposal:** Collect the used copper sulfate solution and any solid waste in designated containers for heavy‑metal waste. Do not pour down the drain.

## Step‑by‑Step Instructions
### 1. Preparation of Electrodes
- Clean both copper electrodes with fine sandpaper to remove any oxide layer or surface contaminants.
- Rinse thoroughly with distilled water and dry completely in an oven (∼105 °C) for 10 minutes.
- Allow the electrodes to cool in a desiccator or on a clean paper towel.
- Weigh each electrode separately on the analytical balance and record the initial masses (m<sub>anode,0</sub> and m<sub>cathode,0</sub>).

### 2. Preparation of the Electrolyte
- Dissolve an appropriate mass of CuSO₄·5H₂O in distilled water to prepare about 250 mL of a 1.0 M solution (molar mass = 249.68 g mol⁻¹).
- Stir until completely dissolved.
- **Optional:** Add a few drops of dilute sulfuric acid to lower the pH (∼3–4), which helps maintain a clear solution and reduces the chance of forming basic copper salts.

### 3. Assembly of the Electrolytic Cell
- Place the beaker on a stable surface.
- Pour about 200 mL of the copper sulfate solution into the beaker.
- Suspend the two copper electrodes in the solution, ensuring they are parallel and separated by ∼2–3 cm. The electrodes should be immersed to a depth of about 3 cm.
- Connect the electrode that will serve as the **anode** (positive terminal) to the **positive** terminal of the power supply.
- Connect the other electrode (the **cathode**, negative terminal) to the **negative** terminal of the power supply.
- **Important:** Verify the polarity; reversing the connections will cause copper to dissolve from the wrong electrode.

### 4. Performing the Electrolysis
- Set the power supply to a constant current mode (or adjust the voltage to give a current of approximately 0.5–1.0 A). Record the exact current (I) in amperes.
- Start the stopwatch simultaneously with turning on the power supply.
- Allow the electrolysis to proceed for a predetermined time (t), e.g., 30 minutes. Monitor the current periodically and adjust the voltage if necessary to keep it constant.
- During the experiment, observe the color changes: the cathode should become coated with fresh copper (pinkish‑red deposit), while the anode may darken as copper dissolves.

### 5. Stopping the Experiment
- After the chosen time, turn off the power supply and stop the timer. Record the total time (t) in seconds.
- Carefully remove the electrodes from the solution. Rinse them gently with distilled water to remove any adherent electrolyte.
- Dry the electrodes in an oven (∼105 °C) for 10 minutes, then allow them to cool.
- Weigh each electrode again and record the final masses (m<sub>anode,f</sub> and m<sub>cathode,f</sub>).

### 6. Data Recording
- Enter all measured data (initial/final masses, current, time) into a table.
- Calculate the change in mass of each electrode:
  - Δm<sub>cathode</sub> = m<sub>cathode,f</sub> – m<sub>cathode,0</sub> (should be positive, mass gain)
  - Δm<sub>anode</sub> = m<sub>anode,0</sub> – m<sub>anode,f</sub> (should be positive, mass loss)

## Expected Observations
- **Cathode:** A smooth, adherent layer of metallic copper deposits. The electrode gains mass.
- **Anode:** Copper dissolves, causing the electrode to lose mass. The solution may become slightly more blue as copper ions enter the solution, although the concentration change is small if the anode and cathode reactions are stoichiometrically matched.
- **Overall:** The solution remains essentially unchanged in color and concentration, because for every Cu²⁺ reduced at the cathode, one Cu atom is oxidized from the anode.

## Cleanup and Disposal
- Pour the used copper sulfate solution into a designated heavy‑metal waste container.
- Rinse the beaker and electrodes with plenty of water; collect the rinsate in the same waste container.
- Return any unused chemicals to their proper storage.
- Wipe down the work area.

## Notes
- If the current density is too high (e.g., > 2 A dm⁻²), the anode may form a black coating of copper(II) oxide (CuO) or copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O) instead of dissolving cleanly. This side reaction reduces the current efficiency for copper dissolution and may lead to a black coating on the anode. To avoid this, keep the current below 1 A for electrodes of the size recommended.
- The experiment can be repeated with different currents or times to investigate the relationship between charge passed and mass change (Faraday’s law).
