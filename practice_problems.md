# Practice Problems: Copper Electrolysis

These problems are designed to test your understanding of Faraday’s laws, stoichiometry, and the principles of electrolysis. Use the following constants where needed:

- Faraday constant, \(F = 96 485\ \text{C mol}^{-1}\)
- Molar mass of copper, \(M_{\text{Cu}} = 63.546\ \text{g mol}^{-1}\)
- Number of electrons transferred per Cu²⁺ ion, \(n = 2\)

## Problem 1
A student performs the copper electrolysis experiment with a constant current of \(0.650\ \text{A}\) for exactly \(30.0\ \text{minutes}\).

a) Calculate the total charge passed (in coulombs).
b) Using Faraday’s law, determine the theoretical mass of copper that should deposit on the cathode (in grams).
c) If the experimental mass gain at the cathode is \(0.385\ \text{g}\), what is the percent efficiency of the electrolysis?

---

## Problem 2
During a copper‑plating experiment, a cathode gains \(0.124\ \text{g}\) of copper after electrolysis. The anode lost \(0.118\ \text{g}\) of mass.

a) How many moles of copper were deposited at the cathode?
b) Assuming the anode loss is entirely due to oxidation of copper to Cu²⁺, how many moles of copper were dissolved from the anode?
c) Explain any discrepancy between the two amounts (if any) in terms of possible side reactions or measurement errors.

---

## Problem 3
An electrolytic cell with copper electrodes is operated at a constant current for \(2.00\ \text{hours}\). The cathode mass increases by \(1.52\ \text{g}\).

a) Determine the total charge (in coulombs) that must have passed through the cell.
b) What was the magnitude of the current (in amperes)?
c) If the same charge were used to electrolyze water (producing H₂ and O₂), how many moles of hydrogen gas would be generated at STP? (Assume 100% efficiency for water electrolysis, with \(2\ \text{e}^{-}\) per H₂ molecule.)

---

## Problem 4
A power supply delivers a constant voltage across the copper‑electrolysis cell, but the current slowly decreases from \(0.85\ \text{A}\) to \(0.72\ \text{A}\) over the course of the experiment because of increasing resistance from the deposited layer. If the average current over the \(45.0\ \text{minute}\) run is \(0.785\ \text{A}\), what is the expected mass of copper deposited? (Use the average current in your calculation.)

---

## Problem 5 (Challenge)
A student accidentally reverses the connections of the power supply, so the electrode that was intended to be the cathode becomes the anode, and vice versa. The experiment is run for \(20.0\ \text{minutes}\) at \(0.500\ \text{A}\) using the same copper‑sulfate solution and copper electrodes.

a) Write the half‑reactions that will now occur at each electrode.
b) Predict the mass change (gain or loss) at each electrode after the experiment.
c) If the initial masses of both electrodes were \(5.000\ \text{g}\), what will be the mass of each electrode at the end of the experiment? (Assume 100% current efficiency and no side reactions.)
